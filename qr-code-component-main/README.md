### What I learned

How to center an element both horizontally and vertically without flexbox or grid (code given below). Had some trouble at first but figured it out after doing some research.

```css
.card {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  max-width: 300px;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```
